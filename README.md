### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
   
<h2>
  My name is Kim Heetae. I want to be a full stack developer and data scientist. I'm living in Gwangju

  I'm reviewing JavaScript and Java again recently.
</h2>
    
<p>
Fun fact :  I'm a beginner developer who made it in 6 months at the academy. 
            For 6 months, I learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, Spring, Python, etc. on a very basis and worked on 2 projects.
                    I want to be a fairly useful new developer within a year and work for a company.
